# Guessle

A Wordle-type game written in assembly for the LC-3. Designed as a
practice for creating low-level RNG and an entertaining user experience.

I got carried away on an assignment and out-delivered what was required
because I was having fun writing low-level code.

### LC-3; Little Computer 3

The LC-3 is an assembler and simulator developed for educational purposes.
It can run on Windows or Unix platforms, and is available for download
through [McGraw Hill](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0072467509/student_view0/lc-3_simulator.html)
in association with the "Introduction to Computing Systems" book. I have
nothing to do with its development. I was introduced to it through a 
Computer Architecture course, and I was fascinated by writing low-level logic.
